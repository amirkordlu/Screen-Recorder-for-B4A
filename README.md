# Screen-Recorder-for-B4A

You can use this source to develop screen capture applications The library of this source is available on the main site and you can get it from there But this source is a professionally developed version of the library that has worked on visual aesthetics and performance improvements. 
You may not have some of the libraries used in this resource But do not worry, most of the libraries used are related to visual items and you can change them according to your taste.

I do not upload libraries because their versions may be different
You can download all libraries from b4x.com

I hope it will be useful
